Android Engineer Task
=====================

Here at Plum, we work in "[squads](https://labs.spotify.com/2014/03/27/spotify-engineering-culture-part-1/)" – a more startup-appropriate name for saying small, cross-functional teams that are focussed on a mission and KPI.

The fundamental basis of any squad, is a team of kick-ass superheroes. Hence this task,
**The Superhero Squad Maker.** Your mission is to build the ultimate superhero squad using
the [Disney API](https://disneyapi.dev/) for data.

The app is simple. When opened, it shows your current squad at the top (if any) and a list of all characters
from the Disney API. This is the "Root" screen in the Figma project.

Tapping on a character shows details and gives you the option to recruit or fire the character.
("Hero Details" Figma screens)

You're expected to use some sort of in-app data persistence mechanism so the squad persists
between app restarts. ("Root screen - Has Squad" Figma screen)

We've included a design spec describing the user experience and interactions.

No authentication is required to access the Disney API.

Make sure you follow the instructions on applying the correct parameters to all your API requests.

Deliverable
-----------

You should write your solution using Kotlin and deliver it by using the CodeSubmit instructions (Note: CodeSubmit
suggests also uploading a video recording of your finished work. This is optional).
Document your design choices and anything else you think we need to know in the README of the project (or whatever works best for you).

What we look for
----------------

In a nutshell, we're looking for a functioning app and correct, tidy, production-quality
code. Imagine that your code will be read by other developers in your team – keep them happy :-)

Take initiative if needed to cover any “black” spots on the UX flow of the test app, and be as creative as you want!

We don't want you to reinvent the wheel so feel free to use whatever libraries you deem
appropriate, but please explain your decisions.

Bonus if you
----------------

- Use pagination when loading the hero list
- Include any enhancement to the deliverable that adds value, whether it's a feature or a codebase improvement
